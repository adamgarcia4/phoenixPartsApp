# Phoenix Parts Frontend

## Motivation for Project
To provide a complete web app solution that helps to manage and organize the build cycle for a FIRST robot.  

A team is given a mere 6 weeks to ideate, design, and fabricate a competitive robot which consists of 300+ individual parts.  Therefore, because of the highly interconnected nature of a project of this caliber, a centralized system is crucial to ensure a streamlined build process.

Inspiration from this project is from Team 254's Cheesy Parts Management System found here: https://github.com/Team254/cheesy-parts

## Project Goals

This Application helps to streamline the build process by:

1.  Team Login System
  A full registration system and user profile allows an administrator to oversee the progress of each teammate.  Team members are also able to communicate in real time with each other.  Also, this system integrates directly into Slack, the team's primary form of communication.
  
2.  Parts Management System
  This is the core functionality of the application, where the details for a robot part are stored.  Details include: Part Status, Raw Materials, and Machine availability.
  
3.  Machine utilization
  This is a side functionality, where machining times can be managed in order to reduce machine downtime.
